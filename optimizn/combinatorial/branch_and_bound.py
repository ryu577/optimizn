        This function executes either the traditional (bnb_type=0) or modified
        (bnb_type=1) branch and bound algorithm. In traditional branch and
        bound, partial solutions are not evaluated against the current best
        solution, while in modified branch and bound, partial solutions are
        completed and evaluated against the current best solution.
        
        This library's branch and bound implementation and the traditional
        branch and bound algorithm are based on the pseudocode and explanation
        of eager branch and bound presented in source [1]. The modified branch
        and bound algorithm is based on the demonstration of branch and bound
        in source [2].
